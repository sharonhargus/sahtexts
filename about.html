<h1>About Recordings</h1>

<div class="normaltext">
<p>
    Most of these recordings of Ellen Saluskin were originally made on cassette tapes.
    They were stored in various places around Virginia Beavert's house.
    Sharon Hargus digitized them for Virginia.
    Then the two of them started to work on transcribing and translating them, around 2007.
    The sentence translations are mostly Virginia's.
    The transcription and glossing (translations of individual words) were mostly done by Sharon, with Virginia's help in places.
    The work on these texts is still ongoing in 2023.
    Some of the cassette tape recordings were in excellent shape but some were degraded, making them difficult to transcribe and translate.
    One recording was unfortunately mostly recorded over with pop music.
    Many of the recordings appear to have been made by Ellen Saluskin herself.
    Virginia showed her mother how to use a tape recorder, and she recorded her thoughts on many subjects.
    She did have trouble with the recorder from time to time.
